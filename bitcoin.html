Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) said Wednesday that he believes central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not a threat to cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), Reuters reported.

Zhao was asked during a news conference at the Web Summit in Lisbon whether CBDCs could pose a threat to Binance and cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ethereum. He replied:
		</p><p>Is it a threat to Binance or other cryptocurrencies? I don’t think so. I very much think that the more we have, the better.

The Binance CEO opined:
		</p>
		<p>It will validate the blockchain concept so that anybody who still has concerns about the technology will say: ‘Ok, our government is using the technology now.’
